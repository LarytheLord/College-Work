Essential Data Structures for Quants
Quantitative finance (quant) relies heavily on the right data structures to efficiently store, process, and analyze financial time series, portfolios, and models. Mastery of these structures is fundamental for strategy development and execution.

1. Arrays and Vectors
Use: Store sequential data like returns, prices, or signals.

Examples: Python list, NumPy array, C++ vector.

graph TD
    Price1 --> Price2 --> Price3 --> PriceN
Visualize with Mermaid

Often used for time series in backtesting.

2. Matrices
Use: Multidimensional data (e.g., price history of multiple assets, covariance matrices).

Examples: NumPy 2D arrays, pandas DataFrames.

text
graph LR
    Asset1["Asset 1 Prices"]
    Asset2["Asset 2 Prices"]
    Asset3["Asset 3 Prices"]
    Day1["Day 1"]
    Day2["Day 2"]
    Day3["Day 3"]
    Day1 --> Asset1
    Day1 --> Asset2
    Day1 --> Asset3
    Day2 --> Asset1
    Day2 --> Asset2
    Day2 --> Asset3
    Day3 --> Asset1
    Day3 --> Asset2
    Day3 --> Asset3
Useful for portfolio optimization and risk modeling.

3. Hash Maps and Dictionaries
Use: Rapid access to data keyed by instrument, date, or risk factor.

Examples: Python dict, C++ std::map.

text
graph TD
    A[Hash Map]
    A -->|Key=Date| B[Price]
    A -->|Key=Instrument| C[Risk Metric]

Ideal for sparse datasets or irregular trading calendars.

4. Specialized Financial Structures
Bars: time bars, tick bars, volume bars, dollar bars—methods to aggregate price data for different market conditions and finer-grained analysis.

5. Visualizing Data Structures
Example: Array Visualization

![Array visualization sample]

<!-- Substitute with your own local image or use a diagram tool output. Example images can be generated in Excel or using tools like draw.io. -->
Example: Matrix (correlation heatmap)

![Matrix or heatmap illustration]

<!-- Again, you can use a screenshot of a correlation matrix. -->

Interactive Diagrams and Animations
Create animated array and matrix transformations using GIFs (example on Giphy).

Embed interactive Plotly plots in HTML markdown output (Plotly documentation).
